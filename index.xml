      <title>Jenkins X Orchestration: More than Tekton on Steroids</title>

      <description>We may know Jenkins X as a new pure CI/CD cloud native implementation different than Jenkins. It is based on the use of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD&amp;rsquo;s) to experience a seamless execution of CI/CD pipelines. This happens by leveraging the power of Kubernetes in terms of scalability, infrastructure abstraction and velocity.
The new main approach of Jenkins X is about a serverless experience, because there is no more traditional Jenkins engine running.</description>

      <description>The Technologists will be giving a bunch of lightning talks in the DevOps Theater at this years DevOps World | Jenkins World in San Francisco. Some of the topics we will be covering include (many of which we have already blogged about):
 Self-Updating Jenkins: GitOps for Jenkins Configuration  This Lightning Talk will explore using GitOps to automate config updates for the CloudBees Jenkins Distribution.  Jenkins Plugin Management as Code  Let’s admit it, Jenkins Plugin management can be a pain.</description>

      <title>Introduction to GitOps - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/gitops-series-part-1/</link>

      <description>GitOps is a concept that was first coined by Weaveworks in their GitOps - Operations by Pull Request post. The idea itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything particularly new, people had been doing automated operations with infrastructure-as-code for years. But now that there was a descriptive new name for this concept, the DevOps community has really started to embrace it. Especially with the ever growing prevalence of Kubernetes.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading that Weaveworks post since it is always good to understand the origination of a concept.</description>

      <title>Self-Updating Jenkins: GitOps for Jenkins Configuration</title>
      <link>https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/cjd-casc/</link>

      <description>In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through creating a self-updating instance of the CloudBees Jenkins Distribution, with all configuration stored as code in a GitHub repository.
We&amp;rsquo;ll deploy the CJD master as a StatefulSet in a Kubernetes cluster, configure the master using the Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin, and set up a TLS certificate through cert-manager. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll seed a Pipeline job that updates the master upon commit to the Git repository that contains the configuration - enabling GitOps for Jenkins itself.</description>

      <title>CloudBees&#39; Cross Team Collaboration for Asynchronous DevSecOps</title>
      <link>https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/cloudbees-cross-team-and-dev-sec-ops/</link>

      <description>What is Cross Team Collaboration? CloudBees&amp;rsquo; Cross Team Collaboration provides the ability to publish an event from a Jenkins job that triggers any other Jenkins job on the same master or different masters that are listening for that event. It is basically a light-weight PubSub for CloudBees Core Masters connected to CloudBees Operations Center. Jenkins has had the ability to trigger other jobs for quite a while now (and with CloudBees this is even easy to do across Masters), but it always required that the upstream job be aware of the downstream job(s) to be triggered.</description>

      <title>Jenkins Plugins: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</title>
      <link>https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/jenkins-plugins-good-bad-ugly/</link>

      <description>There are over 1600 Jenkins plugins and that is both a blessing and a curse. Of those 1600 plugins only a small percentage are well maintained and tested, and even fewer (140 of 1600+) are part of the CloudBees Assurance Program (CAP) as verified and/or compatible plugins - well tested to interoperate with the rest of the CAP plugins (and their dependencies) and with a specific LTS version of Jenkins.</description>

      <title>Extending Jenkins X for Traditional Deployments with CloudBees Flow</title>
      <link>https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/jenkins-x-flow-integration/</link>

      <description>Jenkins X is quickly becoming the de facto standard for high performing teams wanting to do CI/CD in a highly scalable and fault tolerant environment. For those who haven’t gotten the opportunity to try out Jenkins X, it allows teams to run CI/CD workloads natively in a Kubernetes environment while taking advantage of modern operating patterns like GitOps and serverless architectures. For teams wanting to modernize their continuous integration and continuous deployment capabilities, Jenkins X is the go to solution.</description>
