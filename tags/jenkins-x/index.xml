      <description>We may know Jenkins X as a new pure CI/CD cloud native implementation different than Jenkins. It is based on the use of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD&amp;rsquo;s) to experience a seamless execution of CI/CD pipelines. This happens by leveraging the power of Kubernetes in terms of scalability, infrastructure abstraction and velocity.
The new main approach of Jenkins X is about a serverless experience, because there is no more traditional Jenkins engine running.</description>

      <description>Jenkins X is quickly becoming the de facto standard for high performing teams wanting to do CI/CD in a highly scalable and fault tolerant environment. For those who haven’t gotten the opportunity to try out Jenkins X, it allows teams to run CI/CD workloads natively in a Kubernetes environment while taking advantage of modern operating patterns like GitOps and serverless architectures. For teams wanting to modernize their continuous integration and continuous deployment capabilities, Jenkins X is the go to solution.</description>
