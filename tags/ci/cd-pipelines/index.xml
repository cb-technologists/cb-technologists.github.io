      <description>We may know Jenkins X as a new pure CI/CD cloud native implementation different than Jenkins. It is based on the use of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD&amp;rsquo;s) to experience a seamless execution of CI/CD pipelines. This happens by leveraging the power of Kubernetes in terms of scalability, infrastructure abstraction and velocity.
The new main approach of Jenkins X is about a serverless experience, because there is no more traditional Jenkins engine running.</description>
