      <description>A question my colleagues and I are often asked is &amp;ldquo;if I&amp;rsquo;m already using ECS is there any point in moving to EKS (or Kubernetes in general) for running CloudBees Core?&amp;rdquo; Both Amazon ECS and EKS are great products, but we have a strong preference towards Kubernetes. We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at why in this post.
What are ECS and EKS? These are both services from AWS which deal with container orchestration.</description>
