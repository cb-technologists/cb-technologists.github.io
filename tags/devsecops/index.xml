      <description>Implementing security scanning as a preventative measure in your CI pipeline. Overview Todayâ€™s developers are being empowered to expeditiously innovate, creating new software capabilities and building continuous customer value. At CloudBees, we commonly tell our customers:
 &amp;ldquo;Every business is a software business and is under pressure to innovate constantly. This increased velocity introduces new business risks.

      <description>What is Cross Team Collaboration? CloudBees&amp;rsquo; Cross Team Collaboration provides the ability to publish an event from a Jenkins job that triggers any other Jenkins job on the same master or different masters that are listening for that event. It is basically a light-weight PubSub for CloudBees Core Masters connected to CloudBees Operations Center. Jenkins has had the ability to trigger other jobs for quite a while now (and with CloudBees this is even easy to do across Masters), but it always required that the upstream job be aware of the downstream job(s) to be triggered.</description>
