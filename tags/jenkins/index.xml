      <title>Unprivileged Container Image Builds with img and Jenkins on Kubernetes</title>

      <description>Why use img for container builds? As more organizations turn to containers and Kubernetes to manage their CI/CD workloads, numerous strategies have emerged to handle the actual building of container images within these containerized environments. However, each of these approaches have not been without their security drawbacks (see Kurt Madel&amp;rsquo;s recent post on &amp;ldquo;Securely Building Container Images on Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; for a rundown of these approaches and their security implications.)</description>

      <description>In the second part of this series on best practices for Jenkins (and CloudBees Core) on Kubernetes we will continue to look at security. In this post we will look at how to reduce security risk of using cloud services from Jenkins Kubernetes agents, similar to how the previous post in this series showed how Kubernetes Pod Security Policies can be used with Jenkins Kubernetes agents to limit the security risk of Jenkins agent containers.</description>

      <title>Using Kubernetes Pod Security Policies with CloudBees Core - Jenkins</title>

      <description>What are Pod Security Policies? Although Kubernetes Pod Security Policies are still a beta feature of Kubernetes they are an important security feature that should not be overlooked. Pod Security Policies (PSPs) are built-in Kubernetes resources that allow you to enforce security related properties of every container in your cluster. If a container in a pod does not meet the criteria for an applicable PSP then it will not be scheduled to run.</description>

      <description>Implementing security scanning as a preventative measure in your CI pipeline. Overview Today’s developers are being empowered to expeditiously innovate, creating new software capabilities and building continuous customer value. At CloudBees, we commonly tell our customers:
 &amp;ldquo;Every business is a software business and is under pressure to innovate constantly. This increased velocity introduces new business risks. CloudBees is building the world&amp;rsquo;s first end-to-end automated software delivery system (SDM), enabling companies to balance governance and developer freedom.</description>

      <description>The Technologists will be giving a bunch of lightning talks in the DevOps Theater at this years DevOps World | Jenkins World in San Francisco. Some of the topics we will be covering include (many of which we have already blogged about):
 Self-Updating Jenkins: GitOps for Jenkins Configuration  This Lightning Talk will explore using GitOps to automate config updates for the CloudBees Jenkins Distribution.  Jenkins Plugin Management as Code  Let’s admit it, Jenkins Plugin management can be a pain.</description>

      <title>Introduction to GitOps - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://technologists.dev/posts/gitops-series-part-1/</link>

      <guid>https://technologists.dev/posts/gitops-series-part-1/</guid>
      <description>GitOps is a concept that was first coined by Weaveworks in their GitOps - Operations by Pull Request post. The idea itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything particularly new, people had been doing automated operations with infrastructure-as-code for years. But now that there was a descriptive new name for this concept, the DevOps community has really started to embrace it. Especially with the ever growing prevalence of Kubernetes.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading that Weaveworks post since it is always good to understand the origination of a concept.</description>

      <title>Self-Updating Jenkins: GitOps for Jenkins Configuration</title>
      <link>https://technologists.dev/posts/cjd-casc/</link>

      <description>In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through creating a self-updating instance of the CloudBees Jenkins Distribution, with all configuration stored as code in a GitHub repository.
We&amp;rsquo;ll deploy the CJD master as a StatefulSet in a Kubernetes cluster, configure the master using the Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin, and set up a TLS certificate through cert-manager. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll seed a Pipeline job that updates the master upon commit to the Git repository that contains the configuration - enabling GitOps for Jenkins itself.</description>

      <title>CloudBees&#39; Cross Team Collaboration for Asynchronous DevSecOps</title>
      <link>https://technologists.dev/posts/cloudbees-cross-team-and-dev-sec-ops/</link>

      <description>What is Cross Team Collaboration? CloudBees&amp;rsquo; Cross Team Collaboration provides the ability to publish an event from a Jenkins job that triggers any other Jenkins job on the same master or different masters that are listening for that event. It is basically a light-weight PubSub for CloudBees Core Masters connected to CloudBees Operations Center. Jenkins has had the ability to trigger other jobs for quite a while now (and with CloudBees this is even easy to do across Masters), but it always required that the upstream job be aware of the downstream job(s) to be triggered.</description>

      <title>Jenkins Plugins: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</title>
      <link>https://technologists.dev/posts/jenkins-plugins-good-bad-ugly/</link>

      <description>There are over 1600 Jenkins plugins and that is both a blessing and a curse. Of those 1600 plugins only a small percentage are well maintained and tested, and even fewer (140 of 1600+) are part of the CloudBees Assurance Program (CAP) as verified and/or compatible plugins - well tested to interoperate with the rest of the CAP plugins (and their dependencies) and with a specific LTS version of Jenkins.</description>

      <title>Extending Jenkins X for Traditional Deployments with CloudBees Flow</title>
      <link>https://technologists.dev/posts/jenkins-x-flow-integration/</link>

      <description>Jenkins X is quickly becoming the de facto standard for high performing teams wanting to do CI/CD in a highly scalable and fault tolerant environment. For those who haven’t gotten the opportunity to try out Jenkins X, it allows teams to run CI/CD workloads natively in a Kubernetes environment while taking advantage of modern operating patterns like GitOps and serverless architectures. For teams wanting to modernize their continuous integration and continuous deployment capabilities, Jenkins X is the go to solution.</description>
