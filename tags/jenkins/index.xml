      <description>There are over 1400 Jenkins plugins and that is both a blessing and a curse. Of those 1400 plugins only a small percentage are well maintained and tested, and even fewer (140 of 1400+) are part of the CloudBees Assurance Program (CAP) as verified and/or compatible plugins - well tested to interoperate with the rest of the CAP plugins (and their dependencies) and with a specific LTS version of Jenkins.</description>

      <description>Jenkins X is quickly becoming the de facto standard for high performing teams wanting to do CI/CD in a highly scalable and fault tolerant environment. For those who havenâ€™t gotten the opportunity to try out Jenkins X, it allows teams to run CI/CD workloads natively in a Kubernetes environment while taking advantage of modern operating patterns like GitOps and serverless architectures. For teams wanting to modernize their continuous integration and continuous deployment capabilities, Jenkins X is the go to solution.</description>
